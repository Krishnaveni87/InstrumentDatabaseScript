Hi Hari,


I Checked Maximum Tagno For Each Equipment Type and Each Area,
Need to get Clarification For the below mentioned.

1)We dont have Nomenclature for the area 51,95
2)We dont have any Eq_type as 'U' -->Expendables (Catalyst, Refrigerant, Chemicals)
3)There is no Nomenclature  for Eq_Type -->'M'
4)We dont have Seq_No(Tag) for Most of the Eq_types means when we are trying to get Max(Seq_No) it was showing "Null"
5)For Some of the EQ_Type -->MAX(Tag) is showing that Alpha Numeric Values(Ex:292C,7609J,8771-B).I Highlited these values in attached Excel.
